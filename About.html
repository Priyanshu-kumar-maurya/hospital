            <h1>THE BMW</h1>
            <p>Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG),[4] trading as BMW Group (commonly abbreviated to
                BMW
                , sometimes anglicised as Bavarian Motor Works), is a German multinational conglomerate
                manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. In 1922, the
                name
                and assets
                of Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH (formerly Rapp Motorenwerke) were transferred to Bayerische
                Flugzeugwerke
                AG (formerly
                Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik), thereby giving rise to the company known today as BMW AG.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The company's automobiles are marketed under the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, and motorcycles
                    are
                    marketed under
                    the BMW Motorrad brand. In 2023, BMW was the world's ninth-largest producer of motor vehicles, and
                    the
                    6th largest by
                    revenue,[7] with 2,555,341 vehicles produced in that year alone.[8] In 2023, the company was ranked
                    46th
                    in the Forbes
                    Global 2000.[9] The company has significant motor-sport history, especially in touring cars, sports
                    cars, and the Isle
                    of Man TT.

                    Mexico, South Africa, India, China, and previously also in the Netherlands (ceased in 2023).[10] The

                    Quandt in 1959,
                    saved BMW from bankruptcy, with remaining shares owned by the public.</li>

                <h1>History of BMW</h1>
                <p>The official founding date of the German motor vehicle manufacturer BMW is 7 March 1916, when an
                    aircraft
                    producer
                    called Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik) was established.[1][2] This
                    company
                    was renamed to
                    Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the BMW name dates back to 1917, when Rapp
                    Motorenwerke
                    changed its
                    name to Bayerische Motoren Werke.[3] BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called
                    the
                    BMW IIIa.
                    Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm
                    equipment, household
                    items and railway brakes.</p>
                <p>This was not enough and the company was suspended, effectively bankrupt, from 6 November 1918 to 1
                    February 1919. BMW
                    turned to motorcycle engine manufacturing, building a smooth operating horizontally opposed engine
                    to
                    keep the centre of
                    mass low and thus make a more responsive machine. The engine was well received but the motorcycles
                    made
                    using it were
                    not and sold slowly. BMW's General Director Franz Josef Popp had to branch out again and BMW became
                    a
                    sub-contract
                    manufacturer for braking system manufacturer Knorr Bremse.</p>
                <p>The major shareholder in BMW, Vienna based Italian speculator Camillo Castiglionli, sold all of his
                    shares to Knorr
                    Bremse in May 1920, who then acquired the remaining shares to make BMW a wholly owned subsidiary
                    still
                    run by Popp. Less
                    than two years later Popp persuaded Castiglionli buy back the BMW company name and buy the
                    Bayerische
                    Flugzeugwerke for
                    its production site on the other side of the air field. There the company produced its first
                    motorcycle
                    in 1923. This
                    was the legendary Max Fritz designed BMW R32 shaft drive motorcycle, which featured an integrated
                    gearbox, recirculating
                    rather than total loss lubrication and with the cylinder heads poking out for cooling.</p>
